1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com), go to **Settings** > **Authentication**.

2. Find the {props.idp} integration and select **Edit**.

3. Turn on **Enable SCIM**{props.and}**{props.supportgroups}**.

4. (Optional) Turn on the following settings:

* **Enable user deprovisioning**: [Revoke a user's active session](/cloudflare-one/identity/users/session-management/#per-user) when they are removed from the SCIM application in {props.idp}. This will invalidate all active Access sessions and prompt for reauthentication for any Gateway WARP session policies.
* **Remove user seat on deprovision**: [Remove a user's seat](/cloudflare-one/identity/users/seat-management/) from your Zero Trust account when they are removed from the SCIM application in {props.idp}.
* **Enable group membership change reauthentication**: [Revoke a user's active session](/cloudflare-one/identity/users/session-management/#per-user) when their group membership changes in {props.idp}. This will invalidate all active Access sessions and prompt for reauthentication for any Gateway WARP session policies. Access will read the user's updated group membership when they reauthenticate.

5. Select **Save**.

6. Copy the **SCIM Endpoint** and **SCIM Secret**. You will need to enter these values into {props.idp}.

The SCIM secret never expires, but you can manually regenerate the secret at any time.
